# Nodes tree pathfinder

The idea behind this project is to build a tree structure that simulates chained nodes, take two random nodes and find the short path between them here's a [demo](https://developintech.com/projects/nodes/)

This is far from perfect but it was just an experiment

*This project also uses an third party javascript library called [particles](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) from: [Vincent Garreau - vincentgarreau.com](vincentgarreau.com)*
